Protected password storage!

**The program is not 100% protected, there are some vulnerabilities. Store non-important data and use it at your own risk**

Functions:
* Good encryption algorithm of your data
* Binding to the hardware of your device
* Easy to use
* Open source code. You can make sure on your own that your passwords don't go anywhere.

**And remember, any protection can be bypassed. So, I recommend not saving your important data!**
